## Web-app setup
We can use the web-app in 2 ways:
1) Run the index.html file to open up the index page of the web-app and use the app from there.
2) Install npm live-server using npm install -g live-server and then type live-server in the project directory.
## Web-app features
The app is designed to solve the issue of lost and found items and cab-sharing in the IITH community
1) In the index page, we have options for 3 things - to track and claim items that are found, to track and describe the items that are lost by people 
   and a functionality to assist cab-sharing.
2) When we click on the found card in the index page(index.html), we can fill up a google form to describe the item that we found and 
   monitor the list of items that are found but not claimed.
3) When we click on the lost card in the index page(index.html), we can fill up a google form to describe the item we lost and monitor 
   the list of items that are lost and not found by anyone.
4) When we click on the cab-sharing card in the index page(index.html), we can fill up a google form to describe the date of cab-sharing,
   the destination and arrival place of the cab along with the contact of the passenger. 
5) In the cab-sharing page(cabsharing.html), we can also filter the passengers by the date at which they wish to share their cab.
